# New Repo Project

The new-repo project is a default template for .NET Foundation projects. It's also probably a fine start for other .NET projects (have at it, but change the license). It contains the correct license, a decent README, and initial project structure (including a standard .gitignore for the Visual Studio family of products).

You can learn more about the project from the project [Documentation](Documentation).

## Using New Repo

You can simply `git clone` this project to get started. It is recommended that you don't preserve history of the project (it isn't generally meaningful) for your repo, but make a copy and `git init` your project from source.

Consult [CHECKLIST.md] for helpful suggestions on preparing your repo to go public.

## Building

You don't "build" New Repo, however, this will be meaningful for many other projects.
